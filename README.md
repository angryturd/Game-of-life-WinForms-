# Game-of-life-WinForms-

This is a Conway's Game of Life spinoff made in Windows Forms (a horrible choice for a game platform, I know).
Anyone is free to take the source code (if I ever publish it) and make it their own.

GET STARTED:
Download ppfor.zip, unzip it, launch the .exe

If you need to download a .NET file, do itâ€” it just helps the computer read the code, thus run the game.



Here are the controls: 
(if you don't have a keypad on your keyboard, you won't be able to use some controls)


Left click (drag): revives the cell(s) your mouse hovers over

Right click (drag): kills the cell(s) your mouse hovers over


Delete = Mass Genocide

Insert = Mass Production

R = Restart with random seed and Conway's rules

Backspace = Randomize rules

Enter = Return to Conway's rules without restarting

Space = Pause/Continue

Q = Randomize color scheme

E = Reset color scheme to default

KEYPAD-PLUS = Static mode ON        //Makes each cell's neighbor a new random cell every tick

KEYPAD-MINUS = Static mode OFF
